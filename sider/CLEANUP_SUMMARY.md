# Folder Structure Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated CSS Files**
   - Moved useful utility classes from `src/assets/main.css` to `assets/popup.css`
   - The utility classes include:
     - `.btn-primary` and `.btn-secondary` button styles
     - `.input-field` form input styles
     - `.card` container style
     - `.loading-spinner` animation
     - `.scrollbar-thin` custom scrollbar styles

2. **Removed src Directory**
   - Deleted the entire `src/` directory as it was unnecessary for this browser extension
   - The extension uses plain JavaScript files in the `js/` directory, not a build process

3. **Updated Configuration Files**
   - **tailwind.config.js**: Updated content paths to point to actual project files
   - **tsconfig.json**: Updated include paths and path aliases to reference `js/` instead of `src/`
   - **vite.config.ts**: Updated alias and test setup paths

## Result

The project now has a cleaner structure:
- Single `assets/` folder containing all CSS
- JavaScript files remain in the `js/` directory
- No unnecessary `src/` directory
- All configuration files updated to reflect the new structure

## Note

The Tailwind CSS directives (`@tailwind base`, etc.) from the original `main.css` were not included because this browser extension doesn't appear to use a Tailwind build process. The custom utility classes were preserved and added to `popup.css`.
