# Testing Top Tippers Feature

## What was implemented:

1. **Backend API Endpoint**: `/api/v1/influx/tippers`
   - Accepts POST requests with `days` and `limit` parameters
   - Returns aggregated top tippers sorted by total tokens

2. **InfluxDB Service Method**: `get_top_tippers()`
   - Queries tip events from InfluxDB
   - Groups by username and sums tokens
   - Returns sorted list of top tippers

3. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Updated to use the new API endpoint
   - Time filter dropdown (Today/This Week/This Month)
   - Auto-refresh when new tips are received
   - Shows "No tippers found" when empty

4. **Demo Data Improvements**:
   - More realistic usernames with consistent tipping patterns
   - Increased tip frequency (70% tips, 30% chat)
   - Faster event generation (1-3 seconds between events)

## To test:

1. Make sure the Flask server is running:
   ```bash
   cd server
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open the browser extension in your browser

3. Click the "Attach" button (link icon) in the footer to connect to Chaturbate

4. Click on the "Home" icon in the sidebar

5. Navigate to the "TIPPERS" tab

6. You should start seeing top tippers accumulate as demo events are generated

7. Try changing the time filter dropdown to see different time periods

The demo will generate tip events from users like:
- WhaleKing (big spender: 100-1000 tokens)
- DiamondHands (generous regular: 50-500 tokens)
- LoyalFan (consistent tipper: 25-100 tokens)
- And others...

Tips are now properly aggregated in InfluxDB and displayed sorted by total tokens!
